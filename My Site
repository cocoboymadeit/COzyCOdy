  <p> Besides being a cool place to link all my socials, this website will eventually turn into my personal blog, where all my content will be and you can donate directly to me in the future. I want to post weekly articles about my game progress and cultivate a community where you can share your own thoughts and your own progress. It will take some time to develop, but since I know game development is something I am passionate about, finding others who are also passionate about gamedev feels only right.

  <p> WELCOME! :)</p>
